### twobwm for osx in the works



twobwm
==========
A fast floating WM, with the particularity of having 2 borders, written over the XCB library and derived from mcwm written by Michael Cardell.<br>
In twobwm everything is accessible from the keyboard but a pointing device can be used for move, resize and raise/lower.<br>
WARNING: This WM and this repository are experimental, twobwm is only meant for advance users. <br>
