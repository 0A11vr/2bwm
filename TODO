* Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)

  - Use the new xcb-ewmh for the EWMH hints.

  I suggest listing least these in _NET_SUPPORTED (* marks
  implemented):

     _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS, _NET_WM_DESKTOP*,
     _NET_WM_STATE, _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY,
     _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT, _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,
     _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN, _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW

  _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS can be set to the constant WORKSPACES.

* add xbindkeys/xchainkeys

* Write a better README.md

* resizing like in monsterwm? no pointer warp and be able to resize the 4 corners

* change the pointer while moving or resizing

* make the resize only draw lines

* the keep aspect ratio with mouse

* configs in a text file, dynamically updated

* Handle new modes on physical outputs. What do we have to do?

* A separate workspace list for every monitor.

* static Makefile problem

* Menu

  We might need a menu for hidden windows. Since I'm probably
  implementing menu windows anyway, perhaps I should add a menu with
  basic window functions, like 9wm and twm. This way, one might use
  the window manager without keyboard, if necessary. Not much work if
  I have to do the menu anyway... But also chords?

  On the other hand, see hidden.c and forthcoming external menu
  program.

* Chords

  Maybe have mouse button chords to do move and resize? Configurable
  if on or off?

  Idea from Christian Neukirchen.

* Gaps on borders for docks, status windows et cetera.

  Keep space reserved for Conky, dzen2 et cetera.

  Also respect EWMH hints _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK and _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP.

* Code cleaning

  - Use bitfields instead of extra lists for workspaces?
