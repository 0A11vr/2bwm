* Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)

  - Use the new xcb-ewmh for the EWMH hints.

  I suggest listing least these in _NET_SUPPORTED (* marks
  implemented):

     _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS, _NET_WM_DESKTOP*,
     _NET_WM_STATE, _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY,
     _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT, _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,
     _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN, _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW

  _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS can be set to the constant WORKSPACES.

* Double border patch

* add xbindkeys/xchainkeys

* half vertical, full horizontal maximizing

* When moving windows between monitors, try to place the window on
  roughly the same place on a new monitor, if possible.

* resizing like in monsterwm? no pointer warp and be able to resize the 4 corners

* make the resize only draw lines

* the keep aspect ratio with mouse

* little bug while changing workspace and not focusing a window

* simplify the handle keypress function

* configs in a text file, dynamically updated

* Handle new modes on physical outputs. What do we have to do?

* A separate workspace list for every monitor.

* static Makefile problem

* set default status depending on WM_NAME / WM_ICON_NAME

* Grab specific keys 

  Current code grabs modifier keys and any other keypress. We need to
  specifically grab the keycodes we need. xbindkeys and possibly other
  programs don't work.

  Partially done. Now grabs all our keys unshifted as well as shifted.

* Menu

  We might need a menu for hidden windows. Since I'm probably
  implementing menu windows anyway, perhaps I should add a menu with
  basic window functions, like 9wm and twm. This way, one might use
  the window manager without keyboard, if necessary. Not much work if
  I have to do the menu anyway... But also chords?

  On the other hand, see hidden.c and forthcoming external menu
  program.

* Chords

  Maybe have mouse button chords to do move and resize? Configurable
  if on or off?

  Idea from Christian Neukirchen.

* Snap to border and screen edge, which favours the edge.

* Gaps on borders for docks, status windows et cetera.

  Keep space reserved for Conky, dzen2 et cetera.
  
  Also respect EWMH hints _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK and _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP.

* Use xcb-event's event handlers?

* Configuration file.

* Code cleaning

  - Obivous cleanup: The event switch is way too big.

  - The states are known everywhere. A tight state machine would be
    nicer.

  - Dispatch table with function pointers for key bindings instead of
    keysym->enum->case?

  - Use bitfields instead of extra lists for workspaces?
