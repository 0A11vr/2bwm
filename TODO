* Check why sometimes the WM crashes when creating pop-ups or destroying/unmapping certain windows.

* Rewrite the readme file 
	with more statistic, 
	specifying all the features, 
	adding new scrots,
	link to other documentation,
	why should someone care,etc..

* Toggable sticky workspace per monitor

* Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)

  - Use the new xcb-ewmh for the EWMH hints.

  I suggest listing least these in _NET_SUPPORTED (* marks
  implemented):

     _NET_CLIENT_LIST
     _NET_WM_STATE, _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY,
     _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT, _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,
     _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN

* configs in a text file, dynamically updated

* Handle new modes on physical outputs. What do we have to do?

* A separate workspace list for every monitor.

* static Makefile problem

* Check why the input focus doesn't work well with applications such as macopix

* Code cleaning

  - Use bitfields instead of extra lists for workspaces?
